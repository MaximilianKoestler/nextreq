# nextreq

This started as an idea to build a modern cloud based requirements engineering tool with a backend in Rust and a frontend using Vue.js.

In the end it became more of a technology playground :smiley: .

## deployment
bash script/bootstrap
bash script/package
docker run -p 8000:8000 nextreq --name nextreq_0
